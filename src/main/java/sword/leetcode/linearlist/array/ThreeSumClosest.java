 * @description:
 * Three Sum Closest[adj. 最靠近的]
 * Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number,target.
 * Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
 * For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.
 * The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
 *
 * Solution:
 * 先排序,然后左右夹逼,时间复杂度O(n²)
